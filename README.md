# programming interview

Congratulations on getting it this far in interviews with BuildBetter!

We try to keep our engineering assessments to a minimum while verifying that
the technical competency of candidates is aligned with what we're looking for at BuildBetter. Specifically, we're looking for generalists who can write across the web stack and have
basic algorithmic competency. 

There are two directories in this repo named `backend` and `frontend`. Please do
the exercises as follows - 

1. all the exercises described in `frontend/README.md`
2. JUST challenge 1 in `backend/README.md`. Feel free to familiarize yourself with challenge 2, as that will be done live. 

Lastly, record the time that it took to do this assessment, commit your changes, and send the entire compressed
directory to nikhil@buildbetter.app

Enjoy!
